LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language designed to mimic "lolcat" speech, of popular internet fame.

After getting a feel for the syntactic pitfalls of the language (for instance, tabs in the included interpreter are not whitespace), it's actually really fun to write in. Kinda like a weird combination of scheme and an older imperative language.

hello world in LOLCODE is:

HAI 1.2
    CAN HAS STDIO?
    VISIBLE "HELLO WURLD"
KTHXBYE

my personal favorite is the for loop though:

IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR VAR TIL BOTH SAEM VAR AN 100

I decided on implementing a Mandelbrot Set calculator. The calculator cannot zoom, but the resolution and accuracy can be played with. The output is a heatmap of the function, with 0 being not in the set, and 9 being most probably in the set. I may expand later, but for an esoteric programming language the feature set is so complete I almost feel like I'm cheating
